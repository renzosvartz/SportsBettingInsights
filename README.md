Client Side (React)
index.html is the HTML file that is filled with the React app content
index.js is the starting point of the React app, that finds the root div and puts the App component in it.
App.js is the main component that defines what the user sees including these smaller components
In summary, /public/index.html is the base HTML structure, index.js starts your React app and puts it into the HTML structure, and App.js is the main component where you define what the user sees and interacts with.

Server Side (Node.js with Express)
app.js is the main server file that sets up routes and serves the React app/other things and data like index.html when the URLs are accessed
